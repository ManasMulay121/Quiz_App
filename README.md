# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# To run this
1. clone the repo and ensure that files are there in the cwd
2. after cloning enter "npm install" to install all the necessary dependencies if at all there's any error use the "--legacy-peer-deps" flag
3. now you are ready to run this, ensure these are the files in your cwd
4. And run the command "npm run dev"
5.
